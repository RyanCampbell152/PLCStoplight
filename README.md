The purpose of this project is to recreate the behavior of a stoplight using ladder logic. This design was implemented using an Arduino Uno simulated as a PLC using Open PLC. The ladder logic and wiring diagram are viewable as pdfs in the project. Additionally I have included a youtube video demonstrating the behavior on the Arduino.
